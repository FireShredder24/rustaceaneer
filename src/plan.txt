First, player will enter a class.  This will define their ability scores, and give them a couple miscellaneous items.
The player will then buy some essential items (but not a weapon!) from some vendors in the starting market.

Player will talk to some NPCs and get some information.

Player will exit the market and find their way to a quest-giving NPC.

NPCs are tiered in this way:
Tier 0: Information only
Tier 1: Shop NPC
Tier 2: Quest NPC
Tier 3: Companion NPC
Tier 4: Boss NPC

Items will be stored somehow

The first quest is randomly chosen, as is the design of the town.  

The aim is to create a worldbuilder that uses a seed to generate the same world each time, and to minimize the size of savegames.

All entities should be generated from the world seed based on the location where they spawn, and be saved and generated through a cascading series
of types.  These would follow as such:
- Race (random, weighted by location)
- Ethnicity (random, weighted by location)
- Sex (pure random)
- Appearance (random, weighted by ethnicity-specific table)
- Height (Sliding scale from 1 to 10, short to tall)
- Body type (Sliding scale from 1 to 10, skinny to fat)
- Profession (From a list, can be limited by location)
- Personality (Sliding scale from 1 to 10 rating the NPC's hospitality or "niceness")
- History (all NPCs start with no history; this tracks the player's interactions with them)

The player character follows a similar generation, and cannot be edited by the player at any point throughout the game.

The player will progress through a series of quests, leading up to a final boss.  Everything along the way is randomly generated, and the player
can choose to either end their character's story or continue with a fresh world.
